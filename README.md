## Intended Use

Enclose.IO is offered as a service. The ultimate goal is that users can register their projects into Enclose.IO, and Enclose.IO will produce stand-alone executables automatically with auto-update enabled.

Then in runtime, the executables communicate with the Enclose.IO server to keep itself up to date.

See http://enclose.io/nodec for a working example.
